# Litter-trapping plants in the forest canopy

This work was born from a section of my doctoral project, although currently it has been tremendously improved thanks to new contributors.

ABSTRACT

Background:
Secondary foundation species (FS) are organisms that inhabit ecosystems structurally defined by a primary foundation species, providing additional structure to habitats and communities. Trash-basket epiphytes (TBE) are secondary FS that enhance arboreal soil accumulation, providing shelter to animals, and rooting sites for plants. While their importance may vary across biomes, TBE have been overlooked as drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we discuss the prevalence of TBE across biomes, their effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and future research directions.

Methods:
We performed a systematic literature review of articles, books and theses and collated and synthesised information about the taxonomic distribution of TBE, their effects on ecosystem functions, and reports of plant-animal and plant-plant interactions. Then, we analysed the global distribution of TBE using a generalized linear model and summarised two studies to assess their effects on soil invertebrates.

Results:
We identified 120 publications describing 209 species of TBE. Most TBE belong to Araceae (43%), Polypodiaceae (23%), and Orchidaceae (14%) and occur in all tropical and southern temperate forests. TBE richness peaks in the South-American Pacific mangroves, Eastern Cordillera Real, and the Napo moist forests. TBE effects on ecosystem functions include arboreal soil accumulation, water retention and temperature regulation in the canopy, and nutrient leaching through stem-flow. TBE provide shelter to species in more than 97 animal families, including from invertebrates to mammals, while 72 vascular plants have been reported to root in arboreal soil of TBE.

Conclusions:
TBE are a compelling group of model organisms that can be used to study ecological processes such as facilitation cascades, niche construction, extended phenotypes, or the effects of secondary FS on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. TBE should also be included in forest management plans to enhance the availability of microhabitats in the canopy supporting its associated flora and fauna.
